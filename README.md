# BetterEndForge

Fork of BetterEnd (Forge)
Hoping to Fix Magnesium Compatibility and Implement missing features.


If you're looking for progress updates. Look at the serewrite branch.
Do not expect thsi soon, as I currently have to completely rewrite the mod, as the way Beethoven ported it, makes it too hard to keep up with the original and add new content.
I also have to migrate it back from BCLib, as it currently isn't ported.
